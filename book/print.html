<p>I am Harshil Jani who is an Engineering Student at NIT -Surat in India. My majors are in Electronics and Communications and Minors in Computer Science. I am passionate about Open Source and Linux. I am not expert of technology. But , I love spending my time with tech.</p>
<p>Contributing to Open Source Softwares like LLVM, Gitpod, Fixing Small changes on other random softwares and web apps have been a part of my open source journey. I learnt a lot about Web Based technologies, Compilers, Simulation Softwares, Linux Distros available in market, Embedded Systems, Communication Principles and much more. </p>
<p>This book is about my Google Summer of Code - GSOC journey. My way of writing the things is pretty not so straight forward. I will drive you to many domains and make you believe that managing time to learn so much out there in the world of computing is not really as tough as a newbie would think of it to be. </p>
<p>Let me just tell you that, I am Learning <code>Rust</code> and the MdBook is great Rust Software to allow you to write books just with the help of markdown files. So, While I am writing this book about my GSOC Journey I am learning <code>Markdown</code> Syntax in more complexity if I ever require to do so, If I choose I want more customizations to my book, I will update the Rust Source code of MdBook. And side by side, I will describe my work in <code>Perf</code>, <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>D3.js</code> and other technologies involved. You see, This is how you use your technical knowledge to create something which is unique. There are tons of medium blogs about GSOC Journey. But I want to pen portrait this in a book, Because I am impressed by the book named as <strong>&quot;Crafting Interpreters&quot;</strong> by Robert Nystrom. I too want to make sure that some day soon as I grow older, Some underground kid from a normie lifestyle would read my book and have his own unique creation out of it. </p>
<p>I am Contributor at <strong>CERN-HSF</strong> and I will describe my whole journey with you to let you know how I made it to GSOC and What I am going through right now and what next in the future I will be doing in that regards. We will go through every phase of my exploration. 
I want to bring out the <code>Christopher Columbus</code> out of the readers who will eventually build up the habbit to google the stuffs which I am lazy enough to describe and will be handing over to you as a task.</p>
<p>Don't expect me to explain the features of this book, You can by yourself click anywhere and learn what things goes on when you click here and there. Like Changing themes compatible to your beautiful eyes or may be jumbling through the chapters. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="exploring-open-source"><a class="header" href="#exploring-open-source">Exploring Open Source</a></h1>
<p>It was time of September when I being a kid was exploring the Web technologies and some higher level languages while playing around basic programming questions. I got to see many posts on GSOC but by this time, I was pretty much aware about what GSOC is and how it works. I had read few articles on it and some videos about it. So, I came to know that, It has something to do with Open Source. I was luckily, a linux learner back then, So the curtains of open source were unvailed to me. I had been through the history of great computer scienctists and developers who brought the revolutions like <strong>Linus Torvals</strong>, <strong>Richard Stallman</strong>, <strong>Ken Thomsons</strong> and others as well. </p>
<p>So, I just needed a kick start of contributions. But by this time, I had already used Git, Github for my own personal projects and in some small not so notable hackathons and events. So, I knew pretty well about the terms used in it like Fork, Clone etc. more than my peers because I had founded a failed community with almost 2 Regular members named as <strong>Nactore</strong>. So, At Nactore, I wrote the articles on Git and Github which hardly any of my fellow peers have read. It was tough for me to find an audience as I was not good at marketing my stuff. A bit of Shyness and my own set of principles, disallowed me to continue Nactore Forum (A shitty site hosted on Wix) and It just boom vanished. </p>
<p>I saw a video on FreeCodeCamp <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzeVMecydCE&amp;t=46s&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org">Guide to Open Source</a> and learned how you should use github more efficiently and find good issues for you. Then I started doing so. As said earlier in my Introduction, I was learning C++ in more detail so I started contributing the Fixes in DSA repository in Tenet Coding Organization. Soon, We came to October, Which is popularly known as <strong>HacktoberFest</strong> in the open source world. So, I asked out the ACM Club in my college to organize something for it. At the same time, I had frequent contributions in TENET. So, I was given an opportunity to mentor the HacktoberFest 2021 in Tenet. So, I did so, Merged PRs and Rejected PRs and also contributed to other projects by myself. Now, Hackoberfest was over and I got a T-Shirt for the same by getting my more than 4 PRs Merged. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To those who are entirely new, Google the term &quot;Pull Request and Issues&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I was particpating to other Events like GirlScript Winter Of Contributing (GWOC), Winter Of Code 2.0 (By GDSC IIIT Kalyani). GWOC is all about documentation. I wrote some technical articles and got my PRs merged. This was the time, I was working on some large project (by qunatity) where you might face merge conflicts, Issues closing and reopening, commit squashes etc. I anyway learned many things and standards of open source into this event. By this time, I started exploring the GSOC organizations and Previous Project &quot; It all Comes by Exploration &quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you never visited the GSOC site and explored Archives, Go do that. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In WoC 2.0 by Kalyani I saw LLVM out there which was based on compilers. Other orgs were not catching my interest as I was fed up with web development everywhere and wanted to try something more beautiful. I got a proposal for the same and sent it to mentor out there. It got accepted and then I told my mentor, I know nothing about compilers, What will I do ? He suggested to do some online study work. I got enrolled in a Course by Stanford in Coursera and learned about compilers. Now, I was being told to build the LLVM. But I had a boring Laptop of 4 GB RAM which was not sufficient. So, I skipped the program by informing mentor and kept things on hold. Meanwhile, I contiued with my course and Learnt more around it. Fast forward to Late January 2022. I got myself a new laptop with 16 GB. and I build the software on my system by myself. Let's not get more in detail of my WoC 2.0 Journey which was really a breakthrough in my open source exploration. All thanks to <strong>Nimish Mishra</strong> Who helped me with the contribution process. If you want to know in detail about my LLVM journey Read this article of mine. <a href="https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/woc-2-0-llvm-compiler-infrastructure-experience-dea8324ed734">LLVM Journey</a></p>
<p>I turned out to be a top contributor in both GWOC (Open Source Domain) and GDSC's WoC 2.0. By now, I was comfortable with the open source projects. Now, It was month of February and peak time for all GSOC aspiring candidates. Let's read about GSOC into next section. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="exploring-gsoc"><a class="header" href="#exploring-gsoc">Exploring GSOC</a></h1>
<p>Since, I want to be part of  GSOC, I started exloring more and more organizations and tried to contribute consistently. I had an eye on LLVM,CERN-HSF, Fossology, GFOSS, SPDX, About Code and many others. But, One thing that catched my eye was CERNs workflow. There was an Internal round which you need to get cleared with the mentor in order to discuss the project further in detail. All I did was I went through the requirements and tried learning more about the projects. I like 3 Projects in CERN which were :</p>
<ul>
<li>Geant4 - Data Visualization</li>
<li>ROOT - Cling Interpreter Support for adding libraries </li>
<li>CERN-Box - Migrate Smashbox to Python3</li>
</ul>
<p>I frequently visited the site and read the requirements of the Projects. Meanwhile, I was wondering what is Data Visualization and I saw a video on the TEDx regarding the same. It was very good explaination and presentation about Data Visualization and the best thing which I learned from it was <strong>&quot; It allows you to raise questions that you might not raise with just the raw data without the visuals .&quot;</strong>
This got my interest more and more with the Geant4 project and other part was <strong>perf</strong> profiling tool for Linux. So, I was little aware about Valgrind which is also similar kind of tool. So, What I did was simply, Learned more about this two technology and wrote two articles on Medium. You can read them to kmow in detail about how I used them to gain more insights and knowledge about the techs involved into the Project. <a href="https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/visualizing-data-on-web-390d42e52a51">Data Visualization using D3.JS</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/linux-perf-profiling-227d17101bd6">Perf</a></p>
<p>Parallaly, I was also in attraction of a Simulation Software named as Apothesis which simulated Kinetic Monte Carlo processes. The project was about creating the Parser and generalizing the Input and Output for the simulation software. This was under Greek FOSSology Organization. I was in deep conversation discussing both the projects parallely. In CERN's first round, I was given a task to create a scatter plot based on raw sample file along with some bonus changes. I made the chart and submitted the project in 1 day. And I got a green signal by my mentor <strong>Guillherme Amadio</strong> to start working on proposal and discuss the part later on the proposal itself. I had plenty of questions and he helped with all of them. Finally, I had a proposal ready for submission. Meanwhile, In GFOSS also, I had more clear proposal refinements. You can always mail me <a href="harshiljani2002@gmail.com">@harshiljani2002</a> in case you need any of my proposals.</p>
<p>I had my End-Semester exams going on in the time when the proposals were being reviewed so, I couldn't really get time for more contributions. So, Fast forward, The results were announced and boom </p>
<p>🎉 My proposal was accepted at @CERN-HSF for Geant4 - Performance Analysis and Data Visualization.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="community-bonding-period"><a class="header" href="#community-bonding-period">Community Bonding Period</a></h1>
<p>Before we actually get started with the project, There is a phase of time known as Community Bonding Period.
Each Organization have their own set of rules, workflows and hierarcy to follow. To get new contributors familiar with the organization this period is crucial. In this time, Students get familiar with the work to be done in their community, know their mentors, plan their project in more details, receive guidelines for contribution, gets resoruces to gain knowledge on any topic etc.</p>
<p>Talking about my personal experience, On 20th May I got to know about the selection, Then I got a mail from mentor about an introductory call which we scehduled. In that, All of us Me and both of my mentors <strong>Guillherme Amadio</strong> and <strong>Bernherd Manfred Grubber</strong> had a brief introduction. Further, We had more project oriented discussion about what part am I supposed to look on more often. Then I got some links to Guest Accounts in CERN which was to be used for further communication and activities. After, The first call, I was playing around the repository and had few errors and questions. So, We on the next week had another discussion call where they helped me get these things fixed. Then I was adviced to start working on the project in order to get started. Mentors taught me how the reports were generated, How to generate CSV reports and I got to know more about perf. They shared few presentations and documentations by them which helped me in setting perf. Now, After this I generated the reports by myself, Converted them into HTML Table. At first I used a Python script using Pandas but It was not a good idea because it doesn't allow much customization. So, I figured out by myself and got those table by using D3.js logic itself. Then once the tables were on the page, I worked for filtering out them.</p>
<p>I also got cleared that we were working on CMS which is a general purpose detector at Large Hadron Collider (LHC). I visited the CERN website and had a virtual tour of the CMS. Everything seemed like a rocket science to me, But I was blissfull to have even a virtual tour of it. I wonder how great the people working there might be. Meanwhile, There was a GSOC Global Summit on 3rd June. So, I have attended the whole summit. I have noted few learnings which I took from the summit. Here is an article refering <a href="https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/my-learnings-from-gsoc22-global-summit-dab3e9db392">GSOC Summit Learnings</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, I explored more and more about the project and Now, I was able to explain to people that CERN has CMS detector which was simulated by Geant4 and I am profiling that software and providing the visuals for the same. I also explored the Phonix software of CERN-HSF which simulates CMS, ATLAS and other huge models out there at CERN. Also, Currently the <code>GDML</code> file is not available for ATLAS so we could not add up the visuals for ATLAS currently. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google &quot; GDML &quot; for learning about it and also for virtual tour to CMS just google CMS CERN</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the period, I already had a rough progress to me made and things were under control. Now, It was time to get into the coding journey since the community period was about to end. I also found that, My mentors were quit amazing personalities. One was maintainer at Gentoo Linux and other was very good at Free Running and Parkour. They had really good work life balance I guess. </p>
