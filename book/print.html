<p>I am Harshil Jani who is an Engineering Student at NIT -Surat in India. My majors are in Electronics and Communications and Minors in Computer Science. I am passionate about Open Source and Linux. I am not expert of technology. But , I love spending my time with tech.</p>
<p>Contributing to Open Source Softwares like LLVM, Gitpod, Fixing Small changes on other random softwares and web apps have been a part of my open source journey. I learnt a lot about Web Based technologies, Compilers, Simulation Softwares, Linux Distros available in market, Embedded Systems, Communication Principles and much more. </p>
<p>This book is about my Google Summer of Code - GSOC journey. My way of writing the things is pretty not so straight forward. I will drive you to many domains and make you believe that managing time to learn so much out there in the world of computing is not really as tough as a newbie would think of it to be. </p>
<p>Let me just tell you that, I am Learning <code>Rust</code> and the MdBook is great Rust Software to allow you to write books just with the help of markdown files. So, While I am writing this book about my GSOC Journey I am learning <code>Markdown</code> Syntax in more complexity if I ever require to do so, If I choose I want more customizations to my book, I will update the Rust Source code of MdBook. And side by side, I will describe my work in <code>Perf</code>, <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>D3.js</code> and other technologies involved. You see, This is how you use your technical knowledge to create something which is unique. There are tons of medium blogs about GSOC Journey. But I want to pen portrait this in a book, Because I am impressed by the book named as <strong>&quot;Crafting Interpreters&quot;</strong> by Robert Nystrom. I too want to make sure that some day soon as I grow older, Some underground kid from a normie lifestyle would read my book and have his own unique creation out of it. </p>
<p>I am Contributor at <strong>CERN-HSF</strong> and I will describe my whole journey with you to let you know how I made it to GSOC and What I am going through right now and what next in the future I will be doing in that regards. We will go through every phase of my exploration. 
I want to bring out the <code>Christopher Columbus</code> out of the readers who will eventually build up the habbit to google the stuffs which I am lazy enough to describe and will be handing over to you as a task.</p>
<p>Don't expect me to explain the features of this book, You can by yourself click anywhere and learn what things goes on when you click here and there. Like Changing themes compatible to your beautiful eyes or may be jumbling through the chapters. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="exploring-open-source"><a class="header" href="#exploring-open-source">Exploring Open Source</a></h1>
<p>It was time of September when I being a kid was exploring the Web technologies and some higher level languages while playing around basic programming questions. I got to see many posts on GSOC but by this time, I was pretty much aware about what GSOC is and how it works. I had read few articles on it and some videos about it. So, I came to know that, It has something to do with Open Source. I was luckily, a linux learner back then, So the curtains of open source were unvailed to me. I had been through the history of great computer scienctists and developers who brought the revolutions like <strong>Linus Torvals</strong>, <strong>Richard Stallman</strong>, <strong>Ken Thomsons</strong> and others as well. </p>
<p>So, I just needed a kick start of contributions. But by this time, I had already used Git, Github for my own personal projects and in some small not so notable hackathons and events. So, I knew pretty well about the terms used in it like Fork, Clone etc. more than my peers because I had founded a failed community with almost 2 Regular members named as <strong>Nactore</strong>. So, At Nactore, I wrote the articles on Git and Github which hardly any of my fellow peers have read. It was tough for me to find an audience as I was not good at marketing my stuff. A bit of Shyness and my own set of principles, disallowed me to continue Nactore Forum (A shitty site hosted on Wix) and It just boom vanished. </p>
<p>I saw a video on FreeCodeCamp <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzeVMecydCE&amp;t=46s&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org">Guide to Open Source</a> and learned how you should use github more efficiently and find good issues for you. Then I started doing so. As said earlier in my Introduction, I was learning C++ in more detail so I started contributing the Fixes in DSA repository in Tenet Coding Organization. Soon, We came to October, Which is popularly known as <strong>HacktoberFest</strong> in the open source world. So, I asked out the ACM Club in my college to organize something for it. At the same time, I had frequent contributions in TENET. So, I was given an opportunity to mentor the HacktoberFest 2021 in Tenet. So, I did so, Merged PRs and Rejected PRs and also contributed to other projects by myself. Now, Hackoberfest was over and I got a T-Shirt for the same by getting my more than 4 PRs Merged. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To those who are entirely new, Google the term &quot;Pull Request and Issues&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I was particpating to other Events like GirlScript Winter Of Contributing (GWOC), Winter Of Code 2.0 (By GDSC IIIT Kalyani). GWOC is all about documentation. I wrote some technical articles and got my PRs merged. This was the time, I was working on some large project (by qunatity) where you might face merge conflicts, Issues closing and reopening, commit squashes etc. I anyway learned many things and standards of open source into this event. By this time, I started exploring the GSOC organizations and Previous Project &quot; It all Comes by Exploration &quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you never visited the GSOC site and explored Archives, Go do that. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In WoC 2.0 by Kalyani I saw LLVM out there which was based on compilers. Other orgs were not catching my interest as I was fed up with web development everywhere and wanted to try something more beautiful. I got a proposal for the same and sent it to mentor out there. It got accepted and then I told my mentor, I know nothing about compilers, What will I do ? He suggested to do some online study work. I got enrolled in a Course by Stanford in Coursera and learned about compilers. Now, I was being told to build the LLVM. But I had a boring Laptop of 4 GB RAM which was not sufficient. So, I skipped the program by informing mentor and kept things on hold. Meanwhile, I contiued with my course and Learnt more around it. Fast forward to Late January 2022. I got myself a new laptop with 16 GB. and I build the software on my system by myself. Let's not get more in detail of my WoC 2.0 Journey which was really a breakthrough in my open source exploration. All thanks to <strong>Nimish Mishra</strong> Who helped me with the contribution process. If you want to know in detail about my LLVM journey Read this article of mine. <a href="https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/woc-2-0-llvm-compiler-infrastructure-experience-dea8324ed734">LLVM Journey</a></p>
<p>I turned out to be a top contributor in both GWOC (Open Source Domain) and GDSC's WoC 2.0. By now, I was comfortable with the open source projects. Now, It was month of February and peak time for all GSOC aspiring candidates. Let's read about GSOC into next section. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="exploring-gsoc"><a class="header" href="#exploring-gsoc">Exploring GSOC</a></h1>
<p>Since, I want to be part of  GSOC, I started exloring more and more organizations and tried to contribute consistently. I had an eye on LLVM,CERN-HSF, Fossology, GFOSS, SPDX, About Code and many others. But, One thing that catched my eye was CERNs workflow. There was an Internal round which you need to get cleared with the mentor in order to discuss the project further in detail. All I did was I went through the requirements and tried learning more about the projects. I like 3 Projects in CERN which were :</p>
<ul>
<li>Geant4 - Data Visualization</li>
<li>ROOT - Cling Interpreter Support for adding libraries </li>
<li>CERN-Box - Migrate Smashbox to Python3</li>
</ul>
<p>I frequently visited the site and read the requirements of the Projects. Meanwhile, I was wondering what is Data Visualization and I saw a video on the TEDx regarding the same. It was very good explaination and presentation about Data Visualization and the best thing which I learned from it was <strong>&quot; It allows you to raise questions that you might not raise with just the raw data without the visuals .&quot;</strong>
This got my interest more and more with the Geant4 project and other part was <strong>perf</strong> profiling tool for Linux. So, I was little aware about Valgrind which is also similar kind of tool. So, What I did was simply, Learned more about this two technology and wrote two articles on Medium. You can read them to kmow in detail about how I used them to gain more insights and knowledge about the techs involved into the Project. <a href="https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/visualizing-data-on-web-390d42e52a51">Data Visualization using D3.JS</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/linux-perf-profiling-227d17101bd6">Perf</a></p>
<p>Parallaly, I was also in attraction of a Simulation Software named as Apothesis which simulated Kinetic Monte Carlo processes. The project was about creating the Parser and generalizing the Input and Output for the simulation software. This was under Greek FOSSology Organization. I was in deep conversation discussing both the projects parallely. In CERN's first round, I was given a task to create a scatter plot based on raw sample file along with some bonus changes. I made the chart and submitted the project in 1 day. And I got a green signal by my mentor <strong>Guillherme Amadio</strong> to start working on proposal and discuss the part later on the proposal itself. I had plenty of questions and he helped with all of them. Finally, I had a proposal ready for submission. Meanwhile, In GFOSS also, I had more clear proposal refinements. You can always mail me <a href="harshiljani2002@gmail.com">@harshiljani2002</a> in case you need any of my proposals.</p>
<p>I had my End-Semester exams going on in the time when the proposals were being reviewed so, I couldn't really get time for more contributions. So, Fast forward, The results were announced and boom </p>
<p>🎉 My proposal was accepted at @CERN-HSF for Geant4 - Performance Analysis and Data Visualization.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="community-bonding-period"><a class="header" href="#community-bonding-period">Community Bonding Period</a></h1>
<p>Before we actually get started with the project, There is a phase of time known as Community Bonding Period.
Each Organization have their own set of rules, workflows and hierarcy to follow. To get new contributors familiar with the organization this period is crucial. In this time, Students get familiar with the work to be done in their community, know their mentors, plan their project in more details, receive guidelines for contribution, gets resoruces to gain knowledge on any topic etc.</p>
<p>Talking about my personal experience, On 20th May I got to know about the selection, Then I got a mail from mentor about an introductory call which we scehduled. In that, All of us Me and both of my mentors <strong>Guilherme Amadio</strong> and <strong>Bernhard Manfred Gruber</strong> had a brief introduction. Further, We had more project oriented discussion about what part am I supposed to look on more often. Then I got some links to Guest Accounts in CERN which was to be used for further communication and activities. After, The first call, I was playing around the repository and had few errors and questions. So, We on the next week had another discussion call where they helped me get these things fixed. Then I was adviced to start working on the project in order to get started. Mentors taught me how the reports were generated, How to generate CSV reports and I got to know more about perf. They shared few presentations and documentations by them which helped me in setting perf. Now, After this I generated the reports by myself, Converted them into HTML Table. At first I used a Python script using Pandas but It was not a good idea because it doesn't allow much customization. So, I figured out by myself and got those table by using D3.js logic itself. Then once the tables were on the page, I worked for filtering out them.</p>
<p>I also got cleared that we were working on CMS which is a general purpose detector at Large Hadron Collider (LHC). I visited the CERN website and had a virtual tour of the CMS. Everything seemed like a rocket science to me, But I was blissfull to have even a virtual tour of it. I wonder how great the people working there might be. Meanwhile, There was a GSOC Global Summit on 3rd June. So, I have attended the whole summit. I have noted few learnings which I took from the summit. Here is an article refering <a href="https://medium.com/@harshiljani2002/my-learnings-from-gsoc22-global-summit-dab3e9db392">GSOC Summit Learnings</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, I explored more and more about the project and Now, I was able to explain to people that CERN has CMS detector which was simulated by Geant4 and I am profiling that software and providing the visuals for the same. I also explored the Phonix software of CERN-HSF which simulates CMS, ATLAS and other huge models out there at CERN. Also, Currently the <code>GDML</code> file is not available for ATLAS so we could not add up the visuals for ATLAS currently. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google &quot; GDML &quot; for learning about it and also for virtual tour to CMS just google CMS CERN</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the period, I already had a rough progress to me made and things were under control. Now, It was time to get into the coding journey since the community period was about to end. I also found that, My mentors were quit amazing personalities. One was maintainer at Gentoo Linux and other was very good at Free Running and Parkour. They had really good work life balance I guess. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="week-1"><a class="header" href="#week-1">Week 1</a></h1>
<p>Me and my mentors have settled for Weekly Progress calls about discussing the progress of the project and what next we should be looking into it. The Week starts with this call itself. Now that, I already had a rough progress set, It was more easier to pick more clear ideas based on it. </p>
<p>Let me show you the minimal version of the site which I already had at the start of Week 1 and by the end of community bonding. 
This is still better than what I had for my very first progress. I misunderstood and took the perf text reports and stick them to the site. But then mentors corrected me saying, They don't actually need the Text or CSV report and it was all about converting the generated CSV report to HTML Tables. </p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79367883/174475695-4e1b9179-6c6c-4862-a625-6703bd76536d.png" alt="Before Week 1" /></p>
<p>In this, the table has been loaded from a demo.csv file which was not much filled with data. It was just a sample data file with very less number of entries. Now, If you look closely, There is a threshold based filtering part which I had implemented based on a For loop looping through all the entries and returing the ones that falls under that particular range. It was working well. </p>
<p>Let's get back to discussion in the weekly call. Now, I was expected to add colours to the Tables based on the Metrics and also we had further discussions about the project for each chart individually. I coloured whole row based on a single metric. But, then I was corrected and expected to colour not just whole row but each cell based on their metric measures. So, I changed it as well and made each cell coloured. </p>
<p>Now, One part of the project was to convert the perf reports to csv file using the awk script which was done by my mentor <strong>Guilherme Amadio</strong>. There were now more than one CSVs and we should allow the user to visualize all the reports. So, Next thing which I did was generalizing the loading of CSV file into the site. Currently, All you have to do for adding a CSV file is to add it inside the <code>Data/</code> directory and add the name of file to array. That will load all sort of files. Later I am thinking to even generalize array and let it read files directly from the directory itself. As I fixed this, I was showing this site to a close friend of mine. She, found a bug in it. When I was generalizing the reports, I completely forgot about the Download CSV Button. The file path for the same was broken so when she clicked on it, It gave her 404. And then she reported this to me and it costs me 2 Lolipop Candies😑😑. I fixed this up quickly, So it won't cost me candies and she won't get cavities. </p>
<p>Now, There was some real problem with the threshold. Since, last time I used perf on the reports and generated the CSVs, I got actual data which was quite large compared to my demo data. So, The for loop for threshold was taking much longer time. It was the best possible way to find the entries in threshold ! Because it was O(N) I though like this. But, When I discussed this issue with my mentor he suggested me to apply the filters just using the d3 logic so that, It will get those things coloured during the transpilation of d3 to JavaScript. He shared a sample snippet of how it could be implemented. It helped me in drawing the idea for the same and I was able to implement the logic. But, It also made huge changes into the code. Whole logic was shifted to d3 and everytime new thresholds are there, We need to load the whole CSV to Table reports. It was definately helpful and worked really well as compared to my loop based logic.</p>
<p>The design of site was not so great, Because I had used view-height and view-width everywhere to adjust things. So, I was suggested to use Grid or Flex and make it more responsive. I was also shared tutorials based on it. I was more comfortable with Flex comparatively so I applied the flex to whole site. I think it now looks much better than what It was looking before.</p>
<p>Here is the Screenshot of the site at then end of Week 1. </p>

<p>TLDR :</p>
<ul>
<li>Coloured the individual cells based on metric. </li>
<li>Converted perf Reports to CSV with the help of awk scripts (provided by Mentor).</li>
<li>Converted Threshold Logic from a <code>for</code> Loop to d3.js logic.</li>
<li>Generalized the file input for loading CSVs.</li>
<li>Changed styling of the site using Flex-box.</li>
</ul>

<p>This week was really a week of work and I loved being involved with the Tasks. Just to mention apart from my GSOC, I was selected as a contributor for C4GT which is &quot;Code for Government Technology&quot; Program held by Samagra-Shiksha a part of Indian Government. Now, I was part of two beautiful open source projects from two beautiful Organizations. So, I was expected to learn about React-Admin and JSON-LD and much more popular and underground technology. It was really a booster to my learning curve working with both simultaneously. C4GT is whole different game, If I get time you can expect a separate book for the same by me.</p>
<p>We had a meet at the start of the week where we discussed the progress made last week and then got our next week's tasks listed. Let's talk about all in details.</p>
<p>As you might have already seen the image from last week, The first task was to get the numeric columns before the <code>comm</code>, <code>dso</code> and <code>Symbol</code>. So, I made changes in the script which converted the perf reports to CSV to print the numeric columns first in order. This was easy fix. </p>
<p>Now, the current measures makes no sense to the readers. Raw data is not usefull in any ways. So, We need to convert the data into some relative measures. For Example, In measuring the CPU metrics, If the data file consists of <code>Cycles</code> and <code>Instructions</code> then we need to also add a measure of <code>CPI</code>. Also the raw data must be formated like The Cycles and Instructions must be percentage of total of the respective measures. Similarly for Cache Metrics if we have <code>branches</code> and <code>branch misses</code> then we must add a measure of <code>Branch Miss Rate</code>.There was an issue that some metrics were not calculated by the Intel processors so we couldn't extract those data (L1 instruction loads). So, I spent some time fixing the code for including new metrics and improving the existing ones. At the end, It looks really nice. Don't worry, At the end of page, I will stick the SnapShot. </p>
<p>I was expected to install the <code>CVMFS</code> which is <strong>Cern VM (Virtual Machine) FS (File System)</strong> and mount the geant4 public repository which would create the bare clone on my system and allow me to run the jenkins reports So, I can run the perf reports available in the CI for Geant4. This was important to do because the current flamegraph which I had was not showing up the actual measures. So, I had to set this up and run the jenkins script. Now, Let me describe a problem faced by me in doing this. I use Ubuntu 22.04 ( Sorry to Linux Community, It might hurt the sentiments for using Ubutnu ), But CVMFS don't have the Fuse Libraries set up for 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish. So, I went to the Github Hosted repo and found there, they are working currently for this. But there a simple work-around was suggested, Which was fetching the OpenSSL library by yourself and then using the Fuse for 20.04 as it is because the SSL was not packed by default in Jammy Jellyfish. While exploring this, I found out that the suggest work-around was upgraded to 2.15 form 2.13 and for some reason 2.13 was not existing anymore ont he umd mirror. So, I commented a new work-around in the issue itself and got the CVMFS settled on my system. Now, It was working fine and I mounted the Geant4 repo in it. Next was the CCACHE error while running the jenkins script. I fixed the report script of jenkins and made a pull to the original repo of g4run. And I started running the script. It was working fine, But meanwhile for some spooky reaosons my perf got broke and it was running continuously. So, I was not actually able to run the jenkins script. This is something I need to do it in presence of my mentors in the call itself to let them help me figure out my blunders. </p>
<p>Another task of project for the week was to implement the Tree-Maps from the data which was comming out from the perf reports using a script provided by <code>Guillherme Amadio</code>. Next, I wrote the algo for the treemap. And now, We had the treemaps in the site. But, One problem with them was, Initially When I tried loading the treemaps It won't get rendered. Because the treemap nodes were required to get the offset positions of their measure on the screen size. But, I had used a property of CSS to let the contents of the site being hidden and it was <code>display : none</code> So, All the coordintes were returning 0. It took me a while to figure out why the treeMaps are not loading but finally I found a way out of it to get the <code>display : none</code> property being mocked without actually hidding the elements. 
So, All I did was replaced it with <code>visibility : hidden</code> and <code>position : absoulte</code>. This helped with the site being able to  render treemaps along with the other tab contents. It also improved the buffer performance of the site, Which I measured using performance analytics from the Chrome Dev Tools (Beta). I also added the Inverted Flamegraph but those will be soon replaced by The real working flamegraphs.</p>
<p>As promised in the middle of the text (If you read it fully), Here are some glimses which depicts the progress at the end of this week.
