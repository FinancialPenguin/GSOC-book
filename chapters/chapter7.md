# Week 6

This is the final week before Mid-Evaluation. This gives hopes and confidence to every GSOCer so far that what they are doing is making an impact on lives far from where they are. You embrace the work you have been doing. This is really a good week to get yourself boosted for next half. Starting of from my Meet discussions and then moving around with joy for getting my first salary,surprising my parents, migrating back to campus with a rainy monsoon struggle and fighting the hostel autoritites for the new room allotment, Trying to normalize your new semester schedule and having tons of changes in the week is all filled up with so much of excitements and randomness. Things work completely based on randomness and every second has a new coming thing. 
This is the spontaneousity which I always adore.

On Monday I and Guilherme had a meet where we discussed about the project. I showed him the newly created Scatter-Plots with all the interativites which I have added. It looked good apart from the fact that axis was broken a little bit. In the meeting he told me about the Geant4 Conference which would be coming in few months. So, If They allow me then I can have a chance to visit it in France. This is one of the good news which I could get. Maybe they won't invite but atleast I can have a chance to present it remotely. Also, Now the time has come to integrate my Web reports into the g4run jenkins so developers can actually visualize the charts. 

I also asked about the ATLAS experiment if we have the GDML for the same. So in that regards we explored the FullSimLight which is an ATLAS equivalent for g4run as it is for CMS. I am still not sure about it. Maybe I can explore it a little bit and get myself completely embedded into the FulLSimLight as well. I then asked about WebFest at CERN and other stuffs. Final remarks from the meet were, Everything upto the Mid-Evaluation is being done. Just fix up small errors on the axes and create the skeleton for Spider Plot. 

So, I worked for a good amount of time to figure out how I can show another chart into the tooltip. It got me into a good amount of brainstorming and I ended up creating something which doesn't really exist on the Web. This is one of those rare time when I create things like this. I feel good from inside when something I make is unique and being done for the first time. But Maybe, It exist for some part of which I might not be aware of. So, I cannot really claim to make this mine. I am thinking to write a tutorial just like danny Yang's with the help of which I learned the Spider Plots as Standalone Charts. 

In between we had a C4GT meetup where my mentor wanted to get into `RUST` lang. This was something which I never expected in upcoming 4-5 years. Like, No one from my fellows wanted to be a part of Rust community. They think `C++` is working really well or maybe `Python`. But when I was bangging my head on a 4 gigs Laptop for setting up LLVM I got to know why software engineering is not about writing the code but it is about writing the good code with lower end users in mind. I bet anyone If they can work on LLVM on 4 gigs. If you do it, I will never look on LLVM in my entire life. Since, I have faced the issue already I am very much interested in not ruining the days and night of some other child willing to work on some good software. For me Learning rust and implementing it is cruicial part of ethics. But seeing someone willing to know that there is a good alternative to the languages which we have currently is really nice. I have seen this for the very first time. It came out of nowhere all of a sudden. 

I got my first salary from C4GT. This was something which made me very very happy. I can now pay my semester fees from all of my work in GSOC and C4GT on my own even after sparing the amount for the surprise gift which I gifted to my parents. This really kept me going for other days in the week. 

But I really messed up with my programming skills last week in scatter-plots. I used to use a property `d3.extent()` for getting the maximum and minimum of the values into the plot axes ranges. But I really had no idea that, I was not actually converting the data from string to number. So Let's say your data array is `[2,30,99,1234,75432]` and the extent now was returning with `[2,99]` so this was the thing which really broke my entire plot. And from this I realized whether I messed up the same into the treemaps or reports. But the fix to this was really simple which I got from d3.js documentation. It was about adding `d3.autoType` function to the path where we loaded CSV. So, It would on its own format the data for us. And with just that everything started working perfectly. 

I went back to my campus due to continuation of classes in Offline for new Semester. I think I have bunch of interesting classes for this Semester. One of my favorite subject seems to be Operating Systems. Let's see if I can perform really well into it or not. In monsoon , It will be a gambling game to take the rain-coat or the laptop with you at the places you visit. Maybe this may affect the working ability but managing them will be fun. 

With the Mid-Evaluation approaching this week. I have completed all the Week schedule end to end week by week. Not even an inch of it has been manipulated and this is what I loved most about my GSOC Journey. I was afraid when I started . I used to think how can I get the charts really working. But my mentor almost left me with no stress to work on. Whenever things broke he helped me and I for most of my project journey relied on the Documentation and other likely stuff. It was really a good experience working under CERN-HSF. I think the signal is green for my Mid Evals for sure. I already had the PR for the blog site of HSF in around week 2 or week 3 which was minimum criteria to get yourself clear before evaluation round. 

Let me pass the Screenshot of my newly created Spider-Plot tooltip from this week.
